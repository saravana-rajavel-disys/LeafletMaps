# LeafletMaps

Use VS Code and install the extension "Open in Default Browser". Right-click the HTML file within VS Code and choose "Open in Default Browser" option.

Leaflet is "just" a map API. It doesn't provide data/maps itself. Map imagery is provided by other providers like openStreetMap, Mapbox, Carto, etc., These services help to design and publish maps, where the end-result is a bunch of generated map-tiles stored in the cloud (and some json files).

So, we are consuming map imageryy provided by Mapbox maps in Leaflet to generate the end-result.
